### This is an application of Excange

The application has 2 pages and a top bar navigation. 

The first page is a list/table which shows current exchange rate (buying, selling and median) for all available currencies.

The second page is a currency calculator. It enables selection of currencies and entering the amount which is recalculated using the median exchange rate.

The application is responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop). A REST API I used is available at the following URL: [link](http://hnbex.eu/api/v1/)

To start this app you should clone this repository and open it in some IDE like Visual Studio Code, WebStorm etc.
Into the item Terminal on the top of navigation run app using command 
# npm start

:tada After that the application should be run in a new window of your browser.
